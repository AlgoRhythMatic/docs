# ASA Stats Researcher code of conduct

Draft v.0.1.0 - Use [the official discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/asastats/comments/sbqibb/asa_stats_researcher_code_of_conduct_discussion/) and [Google Docs document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ish8jcSNu2wazU62aalysXwnMoKELEUOz6uau_oLWiE/edit#) for the update suggestions.


# General information

A Researcher is a community member authorized to make contacts and research Algorand projects on behalf of ASA Stats.


# Algorand projects' collecting for research

The ASA Stats community members create requests for implementation in ASA Stats website of Algorand engines/dApps by making comments in the official channels. Those requests are collected by the ASA Stats Taskers and the [issue cards](https://github.com/asastats/docs/blob/main/code-of-conduct.md#issue-creation) are created in the ASA Stats Issue Tracker's Researches board under "Incoming" list.

The ASA Stats Team acknowledges those issues by setting a priority label to it and placing them in the "Backlog" list.

The members of Tasker and Researcher group will make the [Researches document](https://github.com/asastats/docs/blob/main/researches.md) up to date with the Issue Tracker research backlog items.


# Researching process

A Researcher opens a discussion and proposes his/her approach in researching a specific existing issue/project.

The ASA Stats community members, as well as the members of Research and Tasker group confirm or deny the Researcher proposal.

If the proposal is accepted, the Researcher is assigned to related issue/card and it is moved into "In progress" list in the Researches board. The Researcher starts with researching the related Algorand project afterward.

If the research outcomes with complete information that ASA Stats Team need for the actual implementation of the related engine/dApp then the related card is moved under "Done" list and the related item in [Researches document](https://github.com/asastats/docs/blob/main/researches.md) is marked as finished and placed under Finished researches section.

If the research outcomes with only basic/partial information the ASA Stats Team needs for an implementation, then the card is moved to "Done" list with the "[INITIAl]" prefix added to its title. A new card is created in "Incoming" with the "[FINAL]" prefix and a link to the initial research card is added to that card Description field.

If the research outcomes with no significant information update then the Researcher assignment is removed from the card, the Researcher adds a comment to the card with his/her research report, and a card is moved back to the "Backlog" list.
