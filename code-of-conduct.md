# ASA Stats Tasker code of conduct
Draft v2.0.1 - January 29th, 2022

Use [the official discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/asastats/comments/rtprj8/asa_stats_tasker_code_of_conduct_discussion/) and [Google Docs document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fdvNnKWoHgu9VySbUecIERwVdDCzaFLMZlWZhcLG-xk/edit?usp=sharing) for the update suggestions.

# ASA Stats discussions
Everything in the ASA Stats should be decided upon in a public discussion.

There are three types of discussions in the ASA Stats project:

* **DAO discussions**: discussions that are conducted in the [official repository](https://github.com/asastats/dao-discussion/discussions) and are not related to any internal ASA Stats issues

* **Official discussions**: discussions that have a related budget and participation in them in a way that contributions to their outcome will be rewarded. The preferred channel for official discussions is the [ASA Stats subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/asastats/). A Tasker’s participation in the official discussions (or in any other subproject) has no connection whatsoever with their Tasker role.

* **Other discussions**: basically everything else in our official channels. The exception to this are places like the #off-topic channel in our Discord for chatting without any benefit to the project, its users, or the community.

# Role of a Tasker
A Tasker is a member of the ASA Stats community whose main duty is to react to community members' requests and discussions, while efficiently recording and cataloging entries into a tracking system for developers to process.

# Other conditions for becoming a Tasker
As of Thursday, January 13th, a member who is willing to become a Tasker should open a discussion about it in the ASA Stats Discord or subreddit, and an existing Tasker or admin (even distribution is suggested) should conduct a verification based on personal preferences.

# The Process
As noted previously, a Tasker is a member of the ASA Stats community whose main duty is to react to community members' requests.  A Tasker should first react as a Tasker and afterward as a community member.  This means that while acting as a Tasker, a person should seek to simply migrate the community’s requests, from various social media channels, according to a specific ruleset.  The following section seeks to outline this ruleset, establishing the processes and procedures a Tasker should use to perform their daily duties.

## Community channels to monitor
A Tasker must become familiar with the following ASA Stats social media channels, establishing a user in each in order to be able to process requests from the community:
* [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/Vjx7w7pAC7) 
* [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/asastats/)
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/asastatscom)

## Types of requests to monitor
While online representing ASA Stats, Taskers should actively monitor the channels and sites listed above, scanning for community-generated messaging relating to bug reports, feature requests, and general feedback

* **Bug report**: a bug is an error, flaw or fault in ASA Stats website that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways.  
* **Feature request**: a feature request is a specific idea for a new area of functionality that a community member feels will make the ASA Stats website better.
* **General feedback**: the community is always welcomed to provide suggestions, personal opinions, and general feedback (ex: what works, what doesn’t work, odd user interface, etc).

## Community member reactions and notation

### Community members’ :this:
Community members mark a comment with `:this:` when they want to show support for a request they wish to be processed by the Taskers and the team.  Comments with higher volumes of `:this:` should be interpreted as a higher priority.  No rewards will be allocated for adding `:this:` to a request or comment.  If the comment is already `:noted:` by a Tasker then `:this:` becomes optional, but may still be utilized to emphasize agreement or accentuate priority.

### Platform-specific instructions for :this:

* Discord

    * Community members mark a comment with the :this: emoji
    * If a comment's count of `:this:` emoji reaches 5, it should be interpreted by a Tasker as a signal for immediate processing.

* Reddit

    * A community member creates a singleton reply comment containing only `:this:`.  
    * Official marks like `:this:` are added by enclosing the command name by two colons and two backticks **\`:command:\`**.
    * Any other identical comments should be deleted by the commenters or admins.
    * If the `:this:` comment's count of upvotes reaches 10, it should be interpreted by a Tasker as a signal for immediate processing.

* Twitter

    * A community member comments on a tweet with `:this:`. 
    * If the `:this:` comment receives 15 likes, it should be interpreted by a Tasker as a signal for immediate processing.

## Tasker’s reactions and notation
A Tasker’s reaction to a member’s request should adhere to the order of operations specified in the following sections.

### Taskers’ :skip: notation
A Tasker should always `:skip:` a comment when they don't understand its meaning, or when they feel there are Taskers with a better understanding of the topic.

On Reddit and Twitter, a `:skip:` is implied by simply not commenting; there is no need for making a `:skip:` comment on these two platforms.

#### Discord-specific instructions for :skip:
On Discord, a Tasker should mark a comment with the `:skip:` emoji.

### Tasker’s :exists: notation
A Tasker should mark a comment with `:exists:` when they are **certain** that the same/similar request has already been issued or if requested functionality is already implemented on the website.

The same Tasker (or any other community member) is encouraged to provide further explanation.

#### Platform-specific instructions for :exists:
* Discord
     * A Tasker marks the comment with the `:exists:` emoji.
     * A further explanation can be added as a reply to the original comment.
     * Other community members can confirm the mark if they want.
* Reddit
     * A Tasker creates a singleton reply comment containing only `:exists:`.
     * The other identical comments should be deleted by the commenters or admins.
     * A further explanation can be added in the same comment next to the starting `:exists:` followed by a space.
     * The other community members can upvote the `:exists:` comment if they want.
* Twitter
     * A Tasker creates a retweet containing `:exists:` and the original tweet
     * A further explanation can be added in the same tweet next to the starting `:exists:` followed by a space.
     * The other community members can retweet and/or like the `:exists:` tweet if they want.

### Taskers’ :noted: notation
A Tasker should mark a comment with `:noted:` when they **comprehend** what has been asked for and are able to abstract the request into a single title sentence.

Marking a comment with `:noted:` signifies an obligation for the Tasker to create a card in the ASA Stats Issue Tracker under the "Incoming" list in the related board.  Please see the “Issue creation in Trello” section below for more details.

#### Platform-specific instructions for :noted:
* Discord
     * a Tasker marks the comment with `:noted:` emoji
* Reddit
     * A Tasker creates a singleton reply comment containing only `:noted:`
     * The other identical comments should be deleted by the commenters or admins
* Twitter
     * a Tasker creates a retweet containing `:noted:` - which should also contain the original tweet.

### Taskers’ :na: notation
A Tasker marks a comment with `:na:` (*not applicable*) when they are sure that the request won't be implemented in ASA Stats.

Marking a comment with `:na:` creates an obligation for the Tasker to further explain the Tasker's/ASA Stats' reasoning for that to the commenter.

#### Platform-specific instructions for :na:
* Discord
     * A Tasker marks the comment with `:na:` emoji. 
     * The Tasker replies to the original comment with a further explanation.
* Reddit
     * A Tasker creates a singleton reply comment containing only `:na:`.
     * The other identical comments should be deleted by the commenters or admins.
     * A further explanation should be added in the same comment next to the starting `:na:` followed by a space.
* Twitter
     * A Tasker creates a retweet containing `:na:` - which should also contain the original tweet.
     * A further explanation can be added in the same tweet next to the starting `:na:` followed by a space.

### Examples of tasker notations on different platforms
* Discord: use the actual emojis available

* Reddit: spell out the reaction 

* Twitter: spell out the reaction

## Issue handling
ASA Stats uses Trello for issue tracking, which is then automatically synced to GitHub to allow for community viewing.  The following section aims to outline the workflow required for a Tasker to handle and queue community requests for the development team to process.

### Issue creation
The Tasker who has marked a comment with `:noted:` must also create a new card in our Trello issue tracking software.

Each card should be created under the "Incoming" list in either the “Bug Reports” or “Feature Requests” Trello boards.  Bug Reports should be used to track reports of defects, while the Feature Requests board should be used for all other feature requests, enhancements, or improvements.   If the request is a priority bug report or feature request, then the Tasker should label it that way (red/highest priority).

A Tasker should add a link to the original/first comment in the request, and quote either all the comment's text or its relevant parts.

Example:  
https://discord.com/channels/906917846754418770/908054304332603402/912101526581940334
> Could you allow users to see USD value of individual assets in the table at the bottom of a person's address by hovering over? I can hover over the total algo value at the top and get USD value, but not at table below. I do see the button to switch between Algo <-> USD but would be nice to also have the hover 

### Issue acceptance
#### Bug Reports and Feature Requests boards
To accept a new issue in the ASA Stats “Bug Reports” or “Feature Requests” Trello boards, a related official adds a priority label to the issue card, and then transfers it from the “Incoming” list into the "Backlog" or "Backlog (dependent)" list as the first/top card.

A related official in this context represents a member of the ASA Stats Team, a developer in a subproject, a researcher assigned for some ongoing engine we’re going to implement in the ASA Stats website, an admin, etc.

The "Backlog (dependent)" list is used when a request depends on some other functionality or effort the ASA Stats hasn’t implemented yet.

#### Tasks board
Along-side the two community-based request boards, there also exists an internal “Tasks” Trello board that should be monitored by Taskers.

In the case of the “Tasks” board, Taskers may handle various tasks from both the “Incoming” and “Backlog” lists, assuming they understand and are capable of handling the requirements to fulfill the task listed in the summary.

If a Tasker feels they understand what is needed to get the task underway, they should assign their name to the card, move the card into the “In Progress” list, and then open a public discussion in an appropriate related ASA Stats community channel.

### Issue rejection
#### Already exists
If the card issue has already been implemented on the website, then the official marks the card with the "Exists" label, adds the explanation to the card's description field, and moves the card into the "Almost done" list.

A Tasker should then mark the original comment with `:exists:`, reply to it with the explanation copied/pasted from the card's description, and move the card under the "Archived" list.

#### Not applicable
If the card issue isn't possible to implement or in some other way the request won't be processed, then the official marks the card with "Not Applicable" label, adds the explanation to the card's description field, and moves the card into the "Almost done" list.

A Tasker should then mark the original comment with `:na:`, reply to it with the explanation copied/pasted from the card's description, and move the card under the "Archived" list.

### Issue work in progress

An official starts to work on the issue and places the card under the "In progress" list and assigns him/herself to the card afterward.

### Resolved issue
The official who resolved the issue moves the card to "Almost Done".

A Tasker should then mark the original comment with `:addressed:` and move the card into the "Done" list.

#### Platform-specific instructions for :addressed:
* Discord
     * The Tasker marks the comment with `:addressed:` emoji.
     * The Tasker may reply to the original comment with a further explanation.
* Reddit
     * The Tasker creates a singleton reply comment containing only `:addressed:`
     * A further explanation may be added in the same comment next to the starting `:addressed:` followed by a space.
* Twitter
     * The Tasker creates a retweet containing `:addressed:` and the original tweet.
     * A further explanation may be added in the same tweet next to the starting `:addressed:` followed by a space.

### GitHub tracking
Reported bugs and requested features list are hosted in our GitHub for the community to view:

https://github.com/asastats/docs/blob/main/reported-bugs.md

https://github.com/asastats/docs/blob/main/requested-features.md

### Issue evaluation
The cards from the "Done" list are evaluated by the community after every cycle.

A cycle should be set to two weeks and it ends on Friday 23:59 UTC. A community discussion created for the purpose should be opened on the following Saturday and it should outcome with the users’ budget in damo for that cycle.

The cards belonging to the official discussions or to the other subprojects are excluded as they should have their own budgets.

### Commenters' budget and share
The community decides of the shares every original commenter gets.

At the same time or after the previous point, the community decides what is the share of each card in the cycle’s total.


### Taskers' budget
At the same time or after the previous points, the community decides what should be the Taskers budget for the cycle. The influencing factors should be the related users’ budget and the other amount of work done in the cycle, including the Taskers’ work for the subprojects and discussions having their own budgets.


### Taskers' share
Taskers among themselves decide on their individual shares in the cycle’s budget.

If they can’t decide, then they should ask the community to decide for them in a public discussion. No rewards will be provided for such a discussion as such a discussion fails to qualify to be an official discussion. If a community also can’t decide then the Tasker’s cycle budget will be added up to the cycle’s users budget.


### Rewards compiling
A completed cycle list with all the individual shares is sent to the keeper of the Community Rewards Pool.

The keeper checks that all the numbers and the format match. If they don't match then the list is returned back for correction.

The format for the list is the following:

    # this is a comment
    # the next line represents a Discord username
    # and related rewards for the cycle
    username 0.08 damo
    # a minimum amount for now is 0.01 damo (10,000 ASASTATS)
    # so please round the numbers to two decimals in advance
    # the next line represents a Reddit username
    u/username 0.2 damo
    # the next line represents a Twitter handle
    @username 0.05 damo

After the keeper confirms the list is correct, Taskers move the cards from Done to Archived list.

### Usernames public addresses verification
The keeper checks if the usernames are connected with the Algorand addresses

For the missing connections (implies no rewards have been sent yet to that user) an admin from the related channel will reach the user in DM asking for a public Algorand  address.

### Rewards sending
For the missing opt-ins, an admin from the related channel will reach the user in DM asking from them to opt-in for the ASA STats Token.

## Other official discussions and subprojects
Every official discussion or subproject upon finish will get a similar rewards related card under the "Done" list.

The same type of discussions like those for cycle's budgets should take place.

A formatted list having the same format should be sent to the keeper.

## No community rewards will be sent outside of the process
No community rewards will be sent outside of the process defined by this document.

# Tasker Verification Process
Each prospective tasker shall undergo a verification process where he or she shall be tested upon his or her understanding of the project, the presented documents, and the related Tasker procedures. The process shall aim to confirm the candidate's readiness and willingness to perform the stipulated responsibilities, their adaptability for efficient handling of tasks, and allow for a demonstration of their Tasker prowess.

## Verification Methodology
The members of the verification team shall use whatever method that suits them the best to verify a new candidate. This could range from engaging in a public interview, to questions posed at identifying problem solving skills, or could be as simple as thinking someone's being a good person.

Following the completion of the verification process, there shall be a trial phase of 7 days wherein  a to-be-confirmed Tasker is charged with performing certain tasks, an outcome of which shall ultimately reflect and confirm their adeptness and ability to serve as a confirmed Tasker.  

At the end of the trial phase, a committee of existing Taskers will conduct a yes/no vote (majority rules) to ultimately confirm or release the new prospective Tasker.

## Verification Queue
The following members of the community will verify the first batch of Tasker applicants, one at a time:
* AlgoRhythMatic: <open>
* Babbexx22: <open>
* bear1bear2bear3: <open>
* Damo: PonziCream
* rach: jsmithlvdame

After the first batch of applicants is verified/rejected by these 6 members, then we should arrange the time zones and other things for future applicants.

For applicants: if these 6 don't pick you in the following two or three days for verification then you'll get another chance the next week. If you spam those 6 in DM you'll be disqualified.

# Document version control
This document’s versioning uses the format: v.<major>.<minor>.<update>.  The “update” version should iterate any time a change occurs that amounts to more than a simple grammatical or typographic correction.  A “minor” iteration should occur when there are a sufficient amount of “updates” that require a re-sync between Google docs and GitHub.  “Major” changes should be very infrequent, and indicate a significant restructuring of the document.  Upon each iteration of “major” or “minor”, the lower version numbers should be reset to 0.  Upon any version updates, the user should also iterate to the current date.
